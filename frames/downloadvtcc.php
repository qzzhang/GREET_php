<h1>Travel Carbon Calculator</h1>

<p>The Travel Carbon Calculator can be used to estimate your travel carbon footprint and find potential ways to reduce it. The Carbon Calculator uses results from the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model developed at Argonne with fuel economy data from the Environmental Protection Agency and statistics from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Transportation Energy Data Book.</p>
