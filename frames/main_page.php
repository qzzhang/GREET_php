<p>
To fully evaluate energy and emission impacts of advanced vehicle technologies and new transportation fuels,
the fuel cycle from wells to wheels and the vehicle cycle through material recovery and vehicle disposal need to be considered.
Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Argonne has developed a
full life-cycle model called GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation). It allows researchers
and analysts to evaluate various vehicle and fuel combinations on a full fuel-cycle/vehicle-cycle basis.</p>
<p> The first version of GREET was released in 1996. Since then, Argonne has continued to update and expand
the model. The most recent GREET versions are the GREET1 2015 version for fuel-cycle analysis and GREET2 2015 version for vehicle-cycle analysis.</p>
<p>
GREET was developed as a multidimensional spreadsheet model in Microsoft Excel. This public domain model is available free of
charge for anyone to use.</p>

<p>For a given vehicle and fuel system, GREET separately calculates the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumption of total resources (energy in non-renewable and renewable sources), fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, and coal together), petroleum, coal, natural gas and water.
</li>
<li>Emissions of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases - primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).
</li>
<li>Emissions of seven criteria pollutants: volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter with size smaller than 10 micron (PM10), particulate matter with size smaller than 2.5 micron (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and sulfur oxides (SOx).
