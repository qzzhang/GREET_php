<h1>Modules</h1>
<p>Greet offers three modules by default that are distributed with the main software. These modules are using our API to interact with the core of the GREET software</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%;">

</div><b>Database Merging Module</b><br>
<div style="font-size:85%;float:right;">Sabbisetti Raja</div>
<p>
The database merging module allows to merge different databases together. The principal use of this feature
is to allow the user to merge the most recent updates with their database automatically. A secondary use is to
allow collaborative work by having different researchers working on different parts of the database and merging their data.
</p>
<p>
The library is included in the distribution from GREET 2013 release. For more information please see the <a href="http://greet.es.anl.gov/files/greet-manual">user guide</a>.

</div><b>Jet Fuels Module</b><br>
<div style="font-size:85%;float:right;">Sokolov Vadim</div>
<p>
The jet fuel module offer a model for aircraft and jet fuel production that calculates Well To WAke emissions and energy use.
This modules provides the user to add/edit parameters for different types of aircrafts and uses the upstreams of the well to pump
pathway of greet to calculate full life cycle results.

</div><b>Stochastic Module</b><br>
<div style="font-size:85%;float:right;">Dieffenthaler David</div>
<p>
The stochastic module allows the user to define distributions for parameters in GREET and run stochastic simulations. 
The tool actually contains 13 distribution types and 3 sampling methods. Frequency analysis tools are also provided and
available to explore the distributed parameters and results of the model.
</p>
<p>
The module itself and underlying data has greatly been improved in the 2014 release providing with a better UI and updated distribution definitions.

</div><b>CCLUB Module</b><br>
<div style="font-size:85%;float:right;">Dane McFarlane</div>
<p>
The CCLUB module provides a user interface and a link between the CCLUB (Carbon Calculator for Laud Use Change from Biofuels) and the GREET software.
Users are now able to calculate easily the CO2 emissions from land use change and include that into their simulations without the trouble of navigating
though all the spreadsheets of the Excel file.

</div><b>Marine Module</b><br>
<div style="font-size:85%;float:right;">Vadim Sokolov</div>
<p>
The Marine module allows to calculate WTH (Well to Hull) emissions for different vessel types and trips in the U.S. and international waters. The tool
allows to modify ships parameters, segments of the trip and uses the GREET upstream to complete the life cycle of the fuel used by bulk carrier, container vessels and oil tankers.
