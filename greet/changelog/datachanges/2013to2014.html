<h1>Changes from 2013 to 2014 database (r9800 to r10747)</h1>
<p>
Due to these modifications, the old database needs to be converted to the new 2014 format. During that conversion errors may appear; they will be fixed by merging your file with the database update, however obsolete pathways and mixes from the old database will remain.<br>
The obsolete items should not be used, and the user should read the associated notes inserted by the 2014 updates to know about the newly created pathways and mixes as replacement for the obsolete ones.</p>
</p>
<p>
This applies only if you have data stored in a database in the 2013 format and want to upgrade to 2014 format.
In any other cases, you can simply delete all the data related to 2013 in your My Documents\Greet\Data folder and start the software. A new version of the database will be automatically downloaded.
</p>
<p>
This page lists the pathways and mixes that are now obsolete in the database and replaced with newer entities.

<h1>Obsolete Mixes</h1>
<p>
Many mixes were removed because their output was never used in any transportation system directly. In the 2013 version of GREET, we were constrained to 
create pathways and mixes to achieve complex structures.

<br><div style="font-size:80%">Structure simplification by reducing the amount of pathways and mixes needed.</div>
</div>
<p>
In GREET 2014 complex structure can be achieved in a single pathway, and there is no need to create trees of pathways and mixes interconnected together.<br>
The figure above shows how two pathways and one mix where fusioned together in the 2014 version of the database, thus no need for Pathway A, Pathway B and Mix A: 
They have all been replaced by Pathway C that encapsulate all processes.
