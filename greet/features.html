<h1>Navigate through the model</h1>
<p>
Navigating fuel production pathways is achieved using the well to product explorer.
</p>
<div id="image" style="float: right;"><img alt="Well to product explorer" src="pic%5Cwtp.png" style="border: 0px none ; margin-top: 3px;" width="300">
<br><div style="font-size:80%">well to product explorer</div>
</div>
<p>
Through the well to product explorer each individual process in a pathway can be expanded 
to expose details of inputs and technologies used.
</p>
<p>
Users can view and choose upstreams for each input, access technologies and emission factors, and examine process fuel shares.

<h1>Building complex pathways within minutes</h1>
<p>
Building a pathway in GREET.net is now accessible to any user without the complexity 
of linking hundreds of equations manually in the model. Our new graphical pathway editor 
allows you to simply drag &amp; drop the processes you want in a pathway, save it and explore the
results in a matter of a few minutes. 
</p>
<div id="image" style="float: left;"><img alt="Graphical Pathway Representation" src="pic%5Cpathway.png" style="border: 0px none ; margin-top: 3px;" width="380">
<br\>
<div style="font-size:80%">Building a new Pathway</div>
</div>
<p>
Currently GREET.net includes more than 300 processes to choose from. Mixes of pathways can also be created to weight the individual pathways for a given product.

<tr><td>
<h1>Add your own data</h1>
<p>
Users can add/modify resources, technologies, processes, pathways and vehicles using intuitive editors.  
</p>
<div id="image" style="float: left;"><img alt="Transportation Process Editor" src="pic%5Ctranspedit.png" style="border: 0px none ; margin-top: 3px;" width="200">
<br><div style="font-size:80%">Transportation Process Editor</div>
</div>
<p>
Building a new transportation process can be achieved by drag &amp; drop of transportation modes and locations. These items can then be linked by drawing lines connecting them.
</p>
<p>
Building a stationary process can be achieved by drag &amp; drop of resources to specify inputs and outputs. Quantities
can be entered in virtually any units, and the results are presented in your preferred set of units.
</p>
<div id="image" style="float: right;"><img alt="Stationary Process Editor" src="pic%5Cstationaryed.png" style="border: 0px none ; margin-top: 3px;"  width="200">

<tr><td>
<h1>Choose your prefered units system</h1>
<p>
The user interface comes with a units system allowing the user to interact with the data using their preferred choice, in addition to performing conversions.
</p>
<p>
The same inputs can be defined using different units or quantities. Mass, Volume or Energy are automatically converted
to perform the simulation.
</p>
</tr></td>

<tr><td>
<h1>Analyze results</h1>
<p>
GREET.net offers multiple levels of results. Users can view process level results with and without upstream included. Users can also see
the well to product results by examining the last process in the fuel production pathway with upstream included.
</p>
<div id="image" style="float: left;"><img alt="WTP Results" src="pic%5Cprores.png" style="border: 0px none ; margin-top: 3px;" width="200">
<br><div style="font-size:80%">Well to process results</div>
</div>
<p>
The available results for a process include upstreams from the wells up to and including this process in the pathway. 
Each individual natural resource used and emissions can be traced in the pathway.
</p>
<div id="image" style="float: left;"><img alt="WTW Results" src="pic%5Cwtwres.png" style="border: 0px none ; margin-top: 3px;" width="200">
<br><div style="font-size:80%">Well to wheels results</div>
</div>
<p>
The well to wheels results, including the vehicle operation, can be viewed on a per mile basis. 
The results of different vehicles can be viewed side by side for comparison.
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<h1>Share your project</h1>
<p>
All of the model's data is stored in a single file that is easy to share and archive. 
</p>
<div id="image" style="float: left;">
<img alt="Xml File" src="pic%5Cxml.png" style="border: 0px none ; margin-top: 3px;" width="230">
<br><br><div style="font-size:80%">Data is stored in a XML structured file</div>
</div>
<p>
The data file contains the necessary information for simulation, as well as the units used, images and notes for individual entities.
</p>
<p>
The file stores both default data supplied by the model and values defined by the user. 
When sharing a data file with others, the modifications can be traced and reverted.
